			<h2>Opauth - Introduction</h2>

			<p>Opauth is a multi-provider authentication framework that offers support for authentication against OAuth or OpenID providers.
			By using Opauth in your application, you can allow your users to use their existing credentials from one of the major web
			applications using OAuth, instead of having to create a new set of credentials, and a new password to remember. Web applications
			that support OAuth include Facebook, Twitter, Google, Instagram, Paypal, LinkedIn, Vimeo, Foursquare and Flickr.
			</p>
			<p>Besides using the OAuth service from one of these OAuth providers, Opauth also provides single-sign-on. When a user is already
			logged-in on the website of one of these services (for example, Facebook), and they come to your website and indicate they want to
			login using their Facebook account, Opauth will detect they are already logged in, and will not prompt the user for any
			credentials. Instead, the user is logged into your application transparently.</p>

			<h3 id="integration">Integration</h3>

			<p>The Auth package provides a wrapper class for the Opauth library, which makes it easy to use in your application, and which provides
			seamless integration with both the Simpleauth and Ormauth driver sets.</p>

			<p>The complete integration means that when a user visits your application for the first time and chooses an OAuth provider as the means
			to login, the Opauth integration class will transparently create a local user account, and logs the user in using that local account.
			This means that all functionality of the Auth driver set you have selected (such as group assignments or ACL's) will also work for users
			logging in through Opauth.
			</p>

			<p>You can also enable multiple provider support. This allows a user to link additional OAuth providers to an existing account,
			whether it is an account transparently created, or an account created manually. So whether they want to use their Facebook, Twitter
			or Google credentials, your application sees the same user account, and ACL's can be applied without having to worry about a user
			being in your system multiple times, which would be more difficult to manage.
			</p>

			<h3 id="install_and_config">Installation and Configuration</h3>

			<p>If this is your first encounter with the Auth package, check the sections on <a href="../simpleauth/intro.html">Simpleauth</a> and
			<a href="../ormauth/intro.html">Ormauth</a> first, make a decision on which one you are going to use, and install that according to
			the instructions. Once you have done that, come back here and read on.</p>

			<p>To be able to use Opauth, you need to install the Opauth library through composer first. Add it to your <strong>composer.json</strong>
			file in the root of your FuelPHP installation:
			</p>

<pre class="javascript"><code>"require": {
	"php": ">=5.3.3",
	"monolog/monolog": "1.5.*",
	"opauth/opauth": "0.4.*",
	"fuelphp/upload": "2.0"
},</code></pre>

			<p>Besides the Opauth library itself, you also need to install strategy packages for each of the OAuth providers you want to
			support in your application. Check the <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/opauth/">Packagist</a> website to see which
			ones are readily available as a composer package. Let's say you want to use Facebook, Google and Github. Your <strong>composer.json</strong>
			should then look like this:</p>

<pre class="javascript"><code>"require": {
	"php": ">=5.3.3",
	"monolog/monolog": "1.5.*",
	"opauth/opauth": "0.4.*",
	"opauth/facebook": "dev-master",
	"opauth/google": "dev-master",
	"opauth/github": "dev-master",
	"fuelphp/upload": "2.0"
},</code></pre>

			<p>After this, run composer to get it all installed:</p>

				<pre class="cli"><code>$ cd /data/www/myfuelwebsite
$ php composer.phar update</code></pre>

			<p>Opauth requires a database table in which the relation between the OAuth credentials and the local user account is stored.
			This table is automatically created for you when you have installed either <a href="../simpleauth/intro.html#database">Simpleauth</a> or
			<a href="../ormauth/intro.html#database">Ormauth</a>.</p>

			<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>

			<p>
				The Opauth wrapper class is configured through a configuration file, not suprisingly called
				<strong>opauth.php</strong>. A default file is provided in the Auth package. You should copy this file
				to your app/config folder before making any changes.
			</p>

			<p>The following configuration values can be defined:</p>
			<table class="config">
				<thead>
					<tr class="header">
						<th style="width:20%;">Param</th>
						<th style="width:10%;">Type</th>
						<th>Default</th>
						<th>Description</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>link_multiple_providers</td>
						<td>boolean</td>
						<td><pre class="php"><code>true</code></pre>
						</td>
						<td>
							Whether or not you want to support linking multiple OAuth providers to a single local account.
							If it is set to <strong>false</strong> and a provider is already linked, the user will get an
							error message when a second provider is used, and the login will be rejected.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>default_group</td>
						<td>int</td>
						<td><pre class="php"><code>1</code></pre>
						</td>
						<td>
							Group ID to assign to new local user accounts transparently created when a user uses an OAuth
							provider for the first time. By default this is the ID of the Simpleauth 'users' group.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>debug</td>
						<td>boolean</td>
						<td><pre class="php"><code>false</code></pre>
						</td>
						<td>
							If <strong>true</strong> it enables the display of debugging messages within the Opauth library
							and Strategy classes. Do not enable this on production sites!
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>security_salt</td>
						<td>string</td>
						<td><pre class="php"><code>null</code></pre>
						</td>
						<td>
							A random string of characters which is used to salt the signing key of the authentication response.
							You are required to define one, make sure it is sufficiently long and completely random!
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>security_iteration</td>
						<td>int</td>
						<td><pre class="php"><code>300</code></pre>
						</td>
						<td>
							Number of iterations to use when generating the signing hash. The higher the number, the more secure
							your signing key is, but also the slower the login process is. This seems to be an acceptable default.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>security_timeout</td>
						<td>string</td>
						<td><pre class="php"><code>'2 minutes'</code></pre>
						</td>
						<td>
							Time limit allowed for an auth response to be considered valid. Starting from auth response generation
							(ie. the time when callback is first requested) to the time when auth response is received and attempts
							validation. Use any value compatible with <strong>strtotime()</strong>.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Strategy</td>
						<td>array</td>
						<td><pre class="php"><code>array()</code></pre>
						</td>
						<td>
							The list of strategies supported by your application, which will include per stategy at your application ID
							and application secret (as assigned to you by the OAuth provider), and any other optional configuration
							items. It is possible to define multiple strategies for the same provider. See
							<a href="https://github.com/opauth/opauth/wiki/Opauth-configuration#guide-to-multiple-configurations-for-a-single-strategy">this page</a>
							for more information.
						</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>

			<p>
				Pay attention to the differences in OpAuth Auth drivers when it comes to callbacks. For example, Facebook doesn't require you
				to define a callback (redirect) URL, Twitter requires one in the form <strong>http://example.com/&lt;controller&gt;/callback/</strong>,
				and Google one like this: <strong>http://example.com/&lt;controller&gt;/&lt;method&gt;/google/oauth2callback</strong> (where "method"
				is the name of the method in your controller that instantiates the Auth_Opauth driver.
			</p>

			<p class="note">Pay very close attention to the value of <strong>default_group</strong>. For Ormauth, group id's are
			not fixed as they are autoincrement in your database table. You don't want to define the wrong one, and ending up
			giving every OAuth user administrator access!!!</p>
