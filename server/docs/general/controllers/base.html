			<h2>Controllers</h2>

			<h3 id="what_is_a_controller">What is a controller?</h3>

			<p>
				Controllers are classes that can be reached through the URL and take care of handling the request.
				A controller calls models and other classes to fetch the information. Finally, it will pass everything
				to a view for output. If a URL like www.yoursite.com/example/index is requested, the first segment
				("example") will be the controller that is called and the second segment ("index") will be the method
				of that controller that is called.
			</p>

			<h3 id="creating_a_controller">Creating a controller</h3>

			<p>
				In FuelPHP, Controllers are put in the <kbd>fuel/app/classes/controller</kbd> directory, and are prefixed
				with <kbd>"Controller_"</kbd>. 	Optionally, they should extend the <kbd>Controller</kbd> class for the full
				feature set. Below is an example of the controller "example":
			</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>class Controller_Example extends Controller
{

	public function action_index()
	{
		$data['css'] = Asset::css(array('reset.css','960.css','main.css'));
		return Response::forge(View::forge('welcome/index'));
	}
}</code></pre>

			<p>
				Methods that can be requested through the URL are prefixed with <kbd>"action_"</kbd>. This means
				that you're not limited by PHP's constructs on which name you might use (example: method "list"
				isn't allowed, "action_list" is no problem). But this also means you can give your controller public
				methods that can be used from other classes but are not routable.
			</p>

			<h3 id="http_method_prefixed_actions">HTTP method prefixed action.</h3>

			<p>
				It's possible to route to HTTP method prefixed actions. Here is an example:
			</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>class Controller_Example extends Controller
{
	public function get_index()
	{
		// This will be called when the HTTP method is GET.
	}

	public function post_index()
	{
		// This will be called when the HTTP method is POST.
	}
}
</code></pre>

			<h4 id="controller_in_subdir">Controllers in Sub-Directories</h4>

			<p>
				You can also put a controller in a subdirectory, like
				<kbd>fuel/app/classes/controller/subdir/test.php</kbd>. In this case, the controller must include
				the dirname in the classname like this: <var>Controller_Subdir_Test</var>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Unlimited nested sub-directories are supported, so
				<kbd>fuel/app/classes/controller/subdir1/subdir2/subdir3/test.php</kbd>. would have a class name of
				<var>Controller_Subdir1_Subdir2_Subdir3_Test</var>.
			</p>

			<h4 id="controller_namespacing">Namespacing controllers</h4>

			<p>
				As mentioned in the introduction by default controllers are created in the <kbd>app/classes/controller</kbd> folder,
				and are prefixed with <var>Controller_</var>. This prefix is defined in your <kbd>app/config/config.php</kbd> configuration file
				(and if not this is the default), but can be changed if you want to namespace your controllers, or if you
				want to move them to a different folder structure.
			</p>

			<p>
				Lets move the example given above to the <kbd>Controller</kbd> namespace. You tell FuelPHP that you've done this by setting the
				config setting <var>controller_prefix</var> from <kbd>'Controller_'</kbd> to <kbd>'Controller\\'</kbd> in your app's config.php file.
			</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>namespace Controller;

class Example extends \Controller
{

	public function action_index()
	{
		$data['css'] = Asset::css(array('reset.css','960.css','main.css'));
		return Response::forge(View::forge('welcome/index'));
	}
}</code></pre>

			<p class="note">
				Note that now that your controller lives in a namespace, you have to prefix "Controller" with a backslash, since it needs to be
				loaded from the global namespace.
			</p>



			<h4 id="more_parameters">Using more parameters from the URL</h4>

			<p>Let say we also have the following method in our Controller_Example: </p>

	<pre class="php"><code>public function action_name_to_upper($name_1, $name_2)
{
	$data['name_1'] = strtoupper($name_1);
	$data['name_2'] = strtoupper($name_2);
	return View::forge('test/name_to_upper', $data);
}</code></pre>

			<p>
				If we call this method using: <kbd>www.yoursite.com/example/name_to_upper/fuel/php</kbd>, it will
				return the view <kbd>test/name_to_upper</kbd>. "FUEL" and "PHP" will be passed along as values
				<var>$name_1</var> and <var>$name_2</var> in the <var>$data</var> array.
			</p>

			<h4 id="returning_results">Returning the result</h4>

			<p>
				Ideally, a controller action must return a Response object. Optionally you can specify special HTTP headers,
				or a custom HTTP status code (a code other than "200 OK"). If you don't return a response object, the default
				<kbd>after()</kbd> method will wrap the return value of the action in a Response object for you.
			</p>

			<p>
				If your controller extends one of the base controllers, your action can also return any value that can be cast to string,
				like for example a View object. The after() method of the base controller will convert it into a Response object for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				If your controller does not extend one of the base controllers, and you want to use this feature,
				your controller must contain it's own after() method that will accept the actions return value, and has to wrap it into
				a Reponse object which it must return.
			</p>

			<h3 id="special_methods">Special controller methods</h3>

			<p class="note">
				Don't overwrite the class constructor <kbd>__construct()</kbd>, use <kbd>before()</kbd> instead.
				Unless you have studied the base Controller from the Core first and understand how it must be extended
				not to break Fuel.
			</p>

			<article>
				<h4 id="action_index">action_index()</h4>
				<p>
					This method will be called if the controller is called without a second parameter. In the above
					example <kbd>www.yoursite.com/example/index</kbd> will be the same as
					<kbd>www.yoursite.com/example</kbd>.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h4 id="before">before()</h4>
				<p>
					The before() method is used as a general pre-method prepping method, to execute code required in
					every controller method called. This method will be executed <strong>before</strong> the method
					from the URL is called on your controller. It will not be called if that method turns out not to exist.
					You should not use this method for routing decisions. If you need that, use the <strong>router</strong> method instead.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h4 id="after">after($response)</h4>
				<p>
					This method will be executed <strong>after</strong> the method from the URL was called successfully,
					this will not be called if the method turns out not to exist. <a href="#response"><var>$response</var></a> parameter is required.
					The after() method <strong>MUST</strong> return a Response object.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					If the <kbd>after()</kbd> method has to construct a Response object, it can use the <kbd>response_status</kbd> property of
					the controller to set the HTTP status of the response. By default, this property contains "200" (OK).
				</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h4 id="router">router($method, $params)</h4>
				<p>
					This method will take over the internal routing of the controller. Once the controller is loaded,
					the router() method will be called and use the <var>$method</var> that is being passed in, instead
					of the default method. It will also pass in <var>$params</var>, in an array, to that
					<var>$method</var>. The before() and after() methods will still work as expected.
				</p>
			</article>

			<h3 id="extending_other_controllers">Extending other controllers</h3>

			<p>
				Thanks to the autoloader, you can extend other controllers without writing anything more than its
				name in the class definition:
			</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>class Controller_Example extends Controller_Welcome
{

	// your methods

}</code></pre>

			<p>
				This may sound strange at first, but extending controllers allows you to share methods and create base
				controllers really easily.
			</p>

			<h3>Creating Base Controllers</h3>

			<p>
				A base controller is a shared controller, like <kbd>Controller_Public</kbd> or <kbd>Controller_Admin</kbd> and are used to share logic between groups of controllers.
				For example, the <kbd>Controller_Admin</kbd> controller could contain your login/logout actions and maybe a dashboard, but it could also contain a <kbd>before()</kbd> method
				that checks to see if the user is logged in as an admin. Then all other controllers in your admin panel will extend this and automatically be secured.
			</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>class Controller_Admin extends Controller
{

	public function before()
	{
		// check for admin
	}

	// your methods

	public function action_index()
	{
		// load the dashboard
	}

	public function action_login()
	{
		// log in the user
	}
}</code></pre>

			<p>
				That code will go in <kbd>fuel/app/classes/controller/admin.php</kbd> and all of your other controllers
				should go in <kbd>fuel/app/classes/controller/admin/</kbd>, like this one:
			</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>class Controller_Admin_User extends Controller_Admin
{

	public function action_index()
	{
		// overrides the dashboard with the user index listing
	}

	public function action_edit($id)
	{
		// edit users
	}
}</code></pre>
